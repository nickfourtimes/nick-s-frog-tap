## about

A short piece I made about NFTs. Pay money to be at the top of the list.

Released on Google Play in January 2022, the app was flagged in autumn 2023 for
imagery that was improperly appealing to the U12 audience (debatable) and its use
of copywritten frogs (also debatable). Combined with new requirements to update
the app's IAP & GPG libraries, I felt keeping it online and up to date was
generally more trouble than the bit was worth.

The present repo is provided for archival purposes & geared towards a WebGL port
of the game, without the fiscal or social stakes involved in the original.

## project setup

[GPG for Unity](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/unity/overview) has been
removed from the project and would need to be reintegrated with corresponding
leaderboards & achievements on the GPG backend. There are some traces of the plugin
lurking in the code, for reference.

## gameplay
